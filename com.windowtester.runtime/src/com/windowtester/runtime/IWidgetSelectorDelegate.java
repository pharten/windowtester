/**
 * Interface for a widget selector that is contributed to the windowtester runtime.
 * <code>IWidgetSelectorDelegate</code>s are registered with the runtime via the runtime's
 * {@link com.windowtester.internal.runtime.selector.IWidgetSelectorService}. Once registered to a class,
 * a widget selector will receive all calls to effect widgets of the type to which it is registered.
 * For instance, if a MyButtonSelector widget selector is registered for the type MyButton, all
 * calls to click a MyButton will be dispatched to the click methods of the MyButtonSelector.  
 * <p>
 * Note that not all methods will be appropriate for all widget types.  For instance, buttons
 * are unlikely to be referenced by path.  In such cases, implementers are encouraged
 * to throw an {@link java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException}.
