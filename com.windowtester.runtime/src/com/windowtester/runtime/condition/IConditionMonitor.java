package com.windowtester.runtime.condition;

import com.windowtester.runtime.IUIContext;

/**
 * A condition monitor checks for registered conditions and activates their associated
 * handlers. The order in which conditions are checked is entirely unspecified. Once a
 * condition is satisfied, the associated handler is activated before checking any
 * remaining conditions. Conditions are not checked during the handling of conditions to
 * prevent infinite recursion.
 * <p>
 * Conditions are processed BEFORE all atomic event generating UIContext actions. For
 * example, conditions are checked before the click method in the following code:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *                public void testMain() throws Exception {
 *                    IUIContext ui = getUIContext();
 *                    ui.click(new MenuItemLocator(&quot;New/Project...&quot;));
 *                    ...
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Conditions are added by obtaining this interface from the IUIContext. The
 * {@link com.windowtester.runtime.condition.ICondition#test()} method and the
 * {@link com.windowtester.runtime.condition.IHandler#handle(IUIContext)} method are both
 * called on the WindowTester test thread, so accessing widgets must be through the
 * IUIContext interface, using locator accessor methods such as a implementor of
 * {@link com.windowtester.runtime.condition.IsEnabled#isEnabled(IUIContext)}, using
 * {@link com.windowtester.runtime.swt.condition.SWTUIConditionAdapter}, or using
 * {@link org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display#syncExec(java.lang.Runnable)}. For example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *                public void testSomething() throws Exception {
 *                    IUIContext ui = getUIContext();
 *                    IConditionMonitor cm = ui.getAdapter(IConditionMonitor.class);
 *                    cm.addHandler(
 *                        new ICondition() {
 *                            public boolean test() {
 *                                ... test some condition here ...
 *                            }
 *                        },
 *                        new IHandler() {
 *                            public void handle(IUIContext ui) {
 *                                ... take some actions here ...
 *                            }
 *                        }
 *                    );
 *                    ...
 * </pre>
 * 
 * or using {@link com.windowtester.runtime.swt.condition.SWTUIConditionAdapter}
 * 
 * <pre>
 *                public void testSomething() throws Exception {
 *                    IUIContext ui = getUIContext();
 *                    IConditionMonitor cm = ui.getAdapter(IConditionMonitor.class);
 *                    cm.addHandler(
 *                        new SWTUIConditionAdapter() {
 *                            public boolean testUI(Display display) {
 *                                ... test some condition here ...
 *                            }
 *                        },
